If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. 
Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer: Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructor methods for a class, a feature known as constructor overloading. 
        We can define different constructors with different parameter lists.
